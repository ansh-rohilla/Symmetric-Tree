# Symmetric-Tree
A recursive helper function is to compare two nodes.The core of the logic lies in the isMirror helper function, which checks if two trees (or subtrees) are mirrors of each other. The isSymmetric function initializes this process by calling isMirror on the tree's root with itself, effectively comparing the left and right subtrees of the main root.
